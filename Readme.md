# InterviewPro - AI-Powered Adaptive Mock Interview Platform

## 📄 Summary of Your Solution (under 150 words)

InterviewPro is an intelligent, adaptive mock interview platform that solves the problem of generic, one-size-fits-all interview preparation. Our solution uses GenAI and RAG techniques to deliver personalized assessments in real-time, adapting question difficulty based on user performance. The platform leverages Gemini APIs for intelligent question generation and evaluation, providing semantic understanding of answers rather than just keyword matching. Built with React, Node.js, and Python, InterviewPro creates dynamic interview experiences that mirror real-world scenarios, helping users improve their skills through personalized feedback and performance analytics.
